# Now

Since I don't actively participate in social media, this is my way of sharing and documenting publicly what I've been up to.<br><span class="text-xs mt-0">Last updated 2020-09-29.</span>

## 🎯 Currently I'm focusing on:

- Making sure I stick to my 6 day morning run routine. I've noticed the weather greatly impacts how I feel for the day, today was especially hard since there was overcast and I just didn't want to do anything. But, I did it and routine still maintained.
- Started applying for permanent roles, wish me luck.
- Coding up a dark and light mode for my site, almost done. I even locked down a logo for myself finally.
- Applying for my Australian Citizenship.
