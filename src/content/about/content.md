# About

Sheila was born and raised in Pasadena, California. Being exposed to the creative arts and sciences at an early age, this has always guided her on the path to learn something new and be curious of how things work.

She currently lives in Sydney, Australia with her partner, a dog named Dev and 3 cats. Sydney is now her home.

## Career

She's worn many hats to propel her employer's business forward. Her hats include: customer service rep, a digital designer, a product manager, a Head of Engineering and all-round glue worker. She's currently enjoying developing front-end apps at SuperChoice.com.au.

Known as the "handywoman" amongst her friends and colleagues, her peers voted her to win back to back "The Duct Tape Award" and "The MacGyver Award" awards at Zanui for being able to fix just about anything.

At this moment she's continuing her studies with learning Frontend development and focusing primarily Accessibility Development and Testing.

## Personal

On her free time, you'll find her sitting under the sun reading a book or playing Shop Heroes on her phone, recreating restaurant meals at home and gardening in the backyard. She enjoys an eclectic range of music and podcasts. Very addicted to watching Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Call of Cthulhu campaign streams. Other times, you'll find her in Monster Hunter World smashing and stunning things with her big-ass hammer or flat out on Dirt Rally 2.0 and F1.
